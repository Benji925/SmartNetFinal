# Smartnet Web App
## Created by: Aaron Portman, Ben Greene, Leah Fernandez, Solomon Lee, and Jane Wang for CS152aj
This is the web edition of the SmartNet application. Its purpose is to help college students and graduates make the most of their networking opportunities. It allows each user to keep track of their contacts in addition with how they met them, where they work, and when to call them again.

### Most Recent Changes:
The most recent update to the page was to deploy the app on Heroku along with CSS changes. Number of contacts should now accurately display on the profile page and contacts will save through the user's Google account.

### Future Features:
As the semester continues, we would like to add
<ol>
  <li>Audio transcription of notes

  <li>Way to upload pictures for contacts
  <li>Custom fields in the forms
  <li>Calls that remind the user of important dates/meetings
</ol>
